# Contributing

There's a couple things to note when you add an article:

1. We anticipate mostly interal contributers. That said, if you're an outsider with a cool articles,
   we'd love to add it. Do note that it needs to be relevant to the VH tech stack. Take a look
   through our repos. We're looking for either technology agnostic articles or articles on
   technologies we use.
2. Do not edit `README.MD`. The README auto-builds based on `src/data.js`. Add your article there by
   following these rules:
   1. If your article is part of an existing category, add it next to the other articles in that
      category.
   2. If you want to add a new category, add it in the appropriate position (the array is
      alphabetical by category).
   3. Otherwise just follow the template (bottom of the file)
3. Make sure there's no syntax errors. You don't need to worry about linting because GitHub actions
   does that for us but syntax is important for obvious reasons.

Thanks!
